**hello, whyeron here.**

i love turning my ideas into reality. i learn as i do it, and i'd like to show them to the like-minded people.<br>
the languages i am confident at is currently python, followed by java, gdscript (godot) and javascript.<br>
i used to code in c#, vba, and lua but that's just not my priority anymore.

**public accounts i'm willing to share.**
