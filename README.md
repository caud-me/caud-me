**hello, whyeron here.**

i love turning my ideas into reality. i learn as i do it, and i'd like to show them to the like-minded people.<br>
the languages i am decent at is currently java, followed by python, gdscript (godot) and javascript.<br>
i used to code in c#, vba, and lua but that's just not my priority anymore.<br>

my goal for this year to simply stay away from the black box, as more and more devs seem to be latching at vibe-coding.<br>
i want to gain ownership of my ideas, my logic, and my code.<br>
everything that i am doing is perhaps inspired by this one particular person.

**public socials i'm willing to share...**
